   // Because declarations marked with the dynamic modifier are dispatched using the Objective-C runtime, theyâ€™re implicitly marked with the objc attribute.
   // It mean that your property/method can be access by Objective-C code or class. Normally it happen when you sub-classing a Swift class of Objective-C base class.

// For some reason NSObjects use a table dispatch
class Person: NSObject {
    func sayHi() {
        print("Hello")
    }
}
func greetings(person: Person) {
    person.sayHi()
}
greetings(person: Person()) // prints 'Hello'

class MisunderstoodPerson: Person {}

// And NSObjects extensions use a DYNAMIC DISPATCH
extension MisunderstoodPerson {
    override func sayHi() {
        print("No one gets me.")
    }
}

//So `sayHi` is not really overriden in terms of table dispatch
greetings(person: MisunderstoodPerson()) // prints 'Hello'
